  screens,
  filter_names = NULL,
  cf1 = 1e+06,

\arguments{
\item{df}{Reads dataframe.}

\item{screens}{List of screens generated with \code{add_screens}.}

\item{filter_names}{List of screen names to filter based on read counts by.}

\item{cf1}{Scaling factor (default 1e6).}

\item{cf2}{Pseudocount (default 1).}

\item{min_reads}{Minimum number of reads to keep (default 30, anything
below this value will be filtered out).}

\item{max_reads}{Maximum number of reads to keep (default 10000, anything
above this value will be filtered out).}

\item{nonessential_norm}{Whether or not to normalize each screen against its
population of core non-essential genes, as defined by Traver et al. 2015 
(default FALSE).}

\item{replace_NA}{Whether or not to replace NA and NULL values in non-T0 screens 
with 0's after filtering out T0 guides with too few or NA readcounts 
(default TRUE).}
}
\value{
Normalized dataframe.
}
\description{
Log2 and depth-normalizes reads between a given list of columns and a given
column of an earlier timepoint (e.g. T0) specified in the "normalize_name"
entry of each screen. Screens with NULL for their "normalize_name" entry
are log2 and depth-normalized, but not normalized to earlier timepoints.
If a screen to normalize against has multiple replicates, those replicates
are averaged before normalization. Multiple replicates for a screen being
normalized, however, are normalized separately against the provided early
timepoint.
